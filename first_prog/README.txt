This is the first program. Next is the task text:

In this option, you need to write two programs.

Program 1 reads a sequence of integers with
standard input and forms a simply connected list of them. Then she
sorts this list in descending order and prints to standard output
the resulting sequence.

Program 2 gets the name of the text file on the command line.
The program should reverse the contents of each line in the file.
The program is not allowed to read the entire file into memory. Can
assume that each line is no longer than 80 characters and it can be
write to memory.
